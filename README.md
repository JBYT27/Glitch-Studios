## About
#### This is a studios presenting jams every now and then. This was created with a [template](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-make-a-web-application-using-flask-in-python-3), which will be mentioned in the credits. It helped me a lot, because I didn't know flask too much. I learned a lot, so yeah.

## Contribution
#### I/we don't really need contributing because all we have to do is post new posts. However, if we do need contributers, we'll let you know!

## Code
#### The code is from a template, then edited [tryhard] into this (lmao). Some features that were added are:
- Repl Auth
- Creating a post (only owners/mods)
- Markdown in posting 
- Different tabs in navbar
#### One thing we haven't managed to do so is the favicon. If you could let us know, it would help us a lot! Thanks!
