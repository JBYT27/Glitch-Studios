# Glitch Studios!
##### An unofficial jam studios presented by @JBYT27
##### Made by @JBYT27, @ch1ck3n, @darkdarcool, and @RayhanADev

## About
#### This is a studio presenting jams now and then. This was created with a [template](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-make-a-web-application-using-flask-in-python-3), which will be mentioned in the credits. It helped me a lot because I didn't know flask too much. I learned a lot, so yeah.

## Contribution
#### I/we don't need to contribute because all we have to do is post new posts. However, if we do need contributors, we'll let you know! Also, we posted some questions now and then, and @ch1ck3n and @Coder100 helped!

## Code
#### The code is from a template, then edited [tryhard] into this (lmao). Some features that were added are:
- Repl Auth
- Creating a post (only owners/mods when a jam is not currently happening.)
- Markdown in posting (special thanks to [this](https://github.com/Grafikart/JS-Markdown-Editor) for allowing us to use markdown for posting!)
- Different tabs in the navbar (posting, logging in, contributors)

#### One thing we haven't managed to do so is the favicon. If you could let us know, it would help us a lot! Thanks!

## Credits
#### Credits goes to [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-make-a-web-application-using-flask-in-python-3) website, it had this template along with CSS and functions, @ch1ck3n for helping me with some errors and repl auth, and @darkdarcool, they didn't know flask much, but they did help as much as they could! Same with @RayhanADev, but they knew a lot about requests and responses (js knowledge :o) so they helped too! :D

## Conclusion
#### I hope you guys enjoy both the website and jam studios! It took us a pretty long time, so it would be appreciated if you gave feedback and commented! Thanks! BAIIII!!!

## Pings
#### Yes. I know. I made a pings header. I just wanted to say sorry for all the useless pings, I just wanted to credit them because they helped a lot. Please don't think I'm trying to cycle farm, etc. Thanks!
